## Term project for 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations

## Siyuan "Daniel" Chen, Michael Zhou

### TODO

- Add more, simpler graphs
  - Write in raw format
  - Translate using `generate.jl`
- Need larger test sets
- Visualize graphs for presentation
- ~~Generate matrix base on nodes~~
- ~~Implement damping~~
- What's next?
- Do some reading: once we have the matrix, how/what do we do with eigenstuff?
  - Apparently simply doing eigen would not work
  - Need to use damping factor since has cycles and sinkholes
